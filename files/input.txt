Strictly speaking, then, the history of haiku begins only in the last years of the 19th century. 
The famous verses of such Edo-period (1600-1868) masters as Basho, Yosa Buson, and Kobayashi Issa are properly referred to as hokku and must be 
placed in the perspective of the history of haikai even though they are now generally read as independent haiku. 
In HAIKU for PEOPLE, both terms will be treated equally! The distinction between hokku and haiku can be 
handled by using the terms Classical Haiku and Modern Haiku.
